## ❌ Missing Components

### Authentication

- [ ] **Clerk** - Complete auth solution with Convex integration
- [ ] **Auth system** - No authentication currently implemented

### Testing & Quality

- [ ] **Playwright** - End-to-end testing framework
- [ ] **Test setup** - No testing infrastructure

### Deployment & Monitoring

- [ ] **Vercel Analytics** - Performance monitoring
- [ ] **Deployment config** - No visible deployment pipeline

### File Handling

- [ ] **Convex File Storage** - Native file uploads and storage

## 🔧 Implementation Gaps

### Backend Integration

- **Current**: Mock data in `/mock-data/`
- **Needed**: Full Convex backend integration
- **Status**: Convex configured but not connected to UI

### Real-time Features

- **Current**: Static state management
- **Needed**: Real-time subscriptions and optimistic updates
- **Gap**: UI not leveraging Convex real-time capabilities

### Type Safety

- **Current**: Frontend TypeScript + Zod validation
- **Needed**: End-to-end type safety with Convex
- **Gap**: Backend schema not integrated with frontend types

## 📊 Compliance Score: 70%

### ✅ Implemented (70%)

- Core framework stack
- UI component system
- State management
- Styling and design system
- Code quality tools

### ❌ Missing (30%)

- Authentication layer
- Testing infrastructure
- Full backend integration
- File handling system
- Performance monitoring

## 🎯 Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Authentication & Backend (High Priority)

1. **Add Clerk authentication**
   ```bash
   pnpm add @clerk/nextjs
   ```
2. **Connect Convex to UI**
   - Replace mock data with Convex queries
   - Implement real-time subscriptions
3. **Type safety integration**
   - Connect Convex schema to frontend types

### Phase 2: Testing & Quality (Medium Priority)

4. **Add Playwright testing**
   ```bash
   pnpm add -D @playwright/test
   ```
5. **Implement E2E test suite**
   - Critical user flows
   - Component integration tests

### Phase 3: Production Features (Low Priority)

6. **File upload system**
   - Convex File Storage integration
   - Image handling for projects/issues
7. **Performance monitoring**
   - Vercel Analytics setup
   - Performance tracking
8. **Deployment pipeline**
   - Vercel configuration
   - Environment management

## 🚀 Current Advantages

### Modern Stack Benefits

- **Next.js 15**: Enhanced App Router, improved performance
- **React 19**: Concurrent features, better hydration
- **Tailwind 4**: Oxide engine, better performance
- **Advanced UI**: Comprehensive shadcn/ui implementation

### Architecture Strengths
